# Project Development Guide

## MVP 

Our MVP will contain a user oriented interface that will retrieve all housing data from the NYC Department of Housing API along with their violations.

Users will be able to sign up/log in to the app to search for homes they're interested in or search for their homes to see if they have any violations on record.

Create profiles for Users

There will be a search checkbox filter to search for homes based on any closed / open violations / boro / etc...

Create back-end API for users and houses.


## Future Development

Functionality for usersâ€™ to put their own homes up for sale

## GIT COMMITS/PUSH

When you are commiting/pushing onto github please follow these steps: 

Branch names should follow this structure: feature-[branch]
    Example: feature-models

git checkout -b [branchname] (creates branch)

git branch (checks all branches on local repo)

** git checkout [branchname] (switches into branch if needed) **

git add/commit/push

Once branch is merged on github DELETE branch.

git branch -d [branchname]
